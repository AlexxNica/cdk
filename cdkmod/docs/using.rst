Using `cdk`
===========

Author an asciidoc document. For example make a file `hello.asc` ::

  Slide 1
  =======

  This is a slide

  Slide 2
  =======

  And another. With a code block:
  
  ----
  >>> print "hello World"
  ----

Run `cdk` on your input file to produce a single html file you can
open in your browser.

::

   $ cdk hello.asc

Open the resulting `hello.html` file in your browser! Hit the space
bar to advance a slide or hit the "h" key to see what other commands
are available to navigate through the deck.
