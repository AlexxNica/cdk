Changelog
=========

Changes between cdk 0.0.2 and 0.0.3
-----------------------------------

UI updates to builtin themes. Added --custom-css flag.

Changes between cdk 0.0.1 and 0.0.2
-----------------------------------

Minor changes. Removed Google Analytics code from default template
(whoops!) and also improved handling of asciidoc `TIP`, `NOTE`,
`CAUTION`, `IMPORTANT` and `WARNING` blocks. See the new
`cdk/custom/icons` directory with a .less file, various png files
(currently just using the images from asciidoc) so that we can base64
these images once instead of repeatedly.
